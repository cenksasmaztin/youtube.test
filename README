This script is a simple Python tool to measure YouTube streaming Quality of Experience (QoE) by resolving the direct video URL and testing the startup delay for the first 1MB of the stream.
Requirements
Python 3.7+
yt-dlp installed at /usr/local/bin/yt-dlp
curl installed on the system
Installation
Install yt-dlp:
sudo pip install yt-dlp
sudo mv $(which yt-dlp) /usr/local/bin/yt-dlp
